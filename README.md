# maint
Maintain your Debian/Ubuntu instance with only one command (instead of two or three).

Installation bash script included for good luck. 
Just run the bash script, and then you should be able to use "maint" to fully update, upgrade, autoremove, repair broken packages, fix missing dependencies,and autoclean.

OR just run:
apt update && apt install curl && curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjgeirk/maint/main/maint' > /usr/local/bin/maint && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/maint

Peace, nerds.
